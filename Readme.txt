Contribution of Team Members :-

Each members of this team have equally given their efforts for finding the efficent output for this assignment program.
Basically,
	    Avinash Prasad tells the best way to create the program and given the concept of terminating and circular 
linked list and helped in creating the createLL() function and debugging of the program.
	    Dhruv jyoti shukla and karthik k has given the concept of travesing the linked list in main() function
and also help in debugging of the program.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Instruction To Run The Program :-

	Actually we used the command line arguments in our program. And by the help of this we can run our program 
in the CMD just by typing the FILENAME and INPUT separated by space.

	Eg :-			FILENAME	N	Ltype
				
				Asn02P05       1000	 0/1

			Where,  
				N is the no. of nodes (user want to create)
				Ltype is the linked type. It may be terminating or circular linked list
			 	depends on user.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Details on example invocation and output :-

		For Example, 
		      1).   If we want to create 10 nodes of Ltype '0'.
			    then the output will be :-
			    
			    C:\Users\AVINASH\Desktop>Asn02P05 10 0
			    Input data for node :
			    10
			    20
			    30
			    40
			    50
			    60
			    70
			    80
			    90
			    100
             		    It Is A Terminating Linked List.

		     2).    If we want to create 10 nodes of Ltype '1'.
			    then the output will be :-

			    C:\Users\AVINASH\Desktop>Asn02P05 10 1
			    Enter data of node :
			    10
			    20
			    30
			    40
			    50
			    60
			    70
			    80
			    90
			    100
			    It Is A Circular Linked List.

Challenges Faced :- 

		     Intially, Our program was showing many errors and even the createLL() function
was not working properly.
		     Also, In the main() function traversing of linked list is not working properly and 
showing many errors.
		     We are not getting the answer in at 3N node traversal and time complexity is High.

		     But Finally by the hard work of our team helped us to reducing the time complexity
of our program and we manage to get the output in efficient manner.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Things We Learnt from our Assignment :-

		This Program helped us to understand the use of Time Complexity and we also shared each others ideas
while creating the Algorithm. We learnt the concept of different types of linked list and traversing of linked list.
We also learnt how to allocate memory dynamically. Even we got to know how to use the CMD to run the Program.

			And Most Important this Program Teaches How to Work in Team.
